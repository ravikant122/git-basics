to unstage a file
git restore --staged <filename>

to see whole history
git log

to delete a commit -> go to its previous commit
git reset <commitId>

to delete a bunch of commits -> go to the previous commit of the last commit in your commit list that you want to delete
git reset <commitIdBeforeLastCommit>

we cannot delete commits in between because all commits are built on the top of their previous commit
we can delete commits in their update date order(Descending)
means if we want to go to the latest 3rd commit, then we've to delete latest 2 commits

when we run this command - git reset <commitId>
then it will undo all the changes of the commits that you've deleted and we'll have this changes as unstaged

now from here, either we can remove these change or stash them
to stash them
git stash

and to bring back the stash content
git stash pop

to clear all stacks
git stash clear
